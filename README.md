# Reminix

Reminix is a web app designed to preserve personal memories as digital time capsules. Users can create and store "echoes" — memories, thoughts, voice notes, or emotions — with a title, date, mood tag, and optionally, a voice snippet or emoji. You can open past echoes to relive the emotions and experiences from those moments.


This project is part of my internship at ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd., where I am working on web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus is on creating a memory-driven app that blends interactive design with personal reflection.
